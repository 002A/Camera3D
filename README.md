Camera3D - 3D Library for [Processing](http://processing.org)
=============================================================

[Processing](http://processing.org) is a Java application popular with artists and creative technologists like myself. Processing allows users to build extensions to expand the application's features and to share those tools with the community. I built one such extension called [Camera3D](http://ixora.io/projects/camera-3D/). My code enables users to employ various 3D algorithms with ordinary 3D OpenGL processing sketches to provide viewers with an illusion of depth. The collection of techniques include anaglyphs (think red-cyan glasses), split frames (think 3D TVs) and split depth optical illusions.

The key insight behind Camera3D is that a Processing sketch's draw method can be called multiple times per frame. This opens up many opportunities to use Processing in new ways. Have a look at the [Camera3D](http://ixora.io/projects/camera-3D/) documentation to learn more.
