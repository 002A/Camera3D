Camera3D - 3D Library for [Processing](http://processing.org)
=============================================================

[Processing](http://processing.org) is a Java application popular with artists and creative technologists like myself. Processing allows users to build extensions to expand the application's features and to share those tools with the community. I built one such extension called Camera3D. My code enables users to employ various 3D algorithms with ordinary 3D OpenGL processing sketches to provide viewers with an illusion of depth. The collection of techniques include anaglyphs (think red-cyan glasses), tools for creating  and split depth optical illusions.
